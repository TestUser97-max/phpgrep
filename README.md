# phpgrep

Syntax-aware grep for PHP code search.

It's very close to [structural search and replace](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/phpstorm/structural-search-and-replace.html)
in PhpStorm, but better suited for standalone usage.

In many ways, inspired by [github.com/mvdan/gogrep/](https://github.com/mvdan/gogrep/).

## Overview

Both a library and a command-line tool.

Library can be used to perform syntax-aware PHP code matching inside Go programs
while binary utility can be used from your favorite text editor or terminal emulator.

> TODO(quasilyte): add more info about it. Plus some examples.
